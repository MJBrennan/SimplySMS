This is a project built with PHP7 and Laravel 5.2. 

Technical Details:
Core Language: PHP7
Hosting: Openshift
Database: MySQL with PHPmyadmin
Framework: Laravel 5.2 
Frontend: HTML,CSS, Javascript(JQuery)
APIs Used: Twilio, Microsoft Contacts

Use Case: This app allows users to send Multiple SMS messages to an unlimited number of users. Users can either enter in Contacts manually or import numbers from their windows live account. In addition allows senders to keep track of past sent messages. Requires a registered account to use. The application is primarily for mobile users and was built with the frontend library Bootstrap.

While this project is mainly for practice I hope to expand this project in the future into something commercially viable. I always think it's good to start from somewhere rather than starting from scratch. It was also interesting to use some of the advanced features of Laravel.
